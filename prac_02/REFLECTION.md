# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

1200-1430 and 2000-2230 on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in my home office, totalling 15 hours per week. 
This includes time spent watching lecture videos, working on practicals and reading relevant chapters from 
the textbook 'Starting out with Python'.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Taking regular breaks during study, debugging and using console to work through issues when stuck, using AnkiApp 
to create flip card decks to assist with spatial learning techniques. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to slow down, unpack and understand a task before rushing in. 

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I'm not being systematic enough. I need to ensure a task is completely finished before moving to the next as time is 
wasted going back to re-check.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am enjoying them :)
